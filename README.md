The motivation of the current project is to get insights from a dataset from Airbnb dating from 2016.

Outline of the Data Analysis:

1. How does the total price of Airbnb vary over the first and second semesters of 2016?
2. How does the total price of Airbnb vary for each day of the week for the first and second semesters of 2016?
3. How does the mean price by the client is distributed over the first and second semesters of 2016?
