# Project Motivation

The motivation of the current project is to get insights from a dataset from Airbnb dating from 2016.

## Title: ANALYSIS OF AIRBNB DATA: THE INFLUENCE OF TIME, DAY OF WEEK, AND CLIENT DISTRIBUTION

Outline of the Data Analysis:

1. How does the total price of Airbnb vary over the first and second semesters of 2016?
2. How does the total price of Airbnb vary for each day of the week for the first and second semesters of 2016?
3. How does the mean price by the client is distributed over the first and second semesters of 2016?

# How to interact to interact with your project

Just download this project and use it with anaconda :)


# Summary of the results of the analysis


1. For the first semester of 2016, the total sales of Airbnb was increasing fastly, but in the second semester, it reached a plateau. 
2. The analysis of the total price by day of the week showed that in the first semester the sales are evenly distributed, while in the second semester they are biased toward Monday and Tuesday. 
3. Analysis of the amount spent by a client showed that in the second amount the mean and maximum values were larger than in the first semester, however, also more spread (larger standard deviation).
